# Reference Disabler

Note: the patcher is not fully tested yet.

Allows you to make a patch to make your entire modlist looking for "Initially Disabled" placed references that have not been properly disabled (missing the Z position at -30000 or the Set enabled to opposite of parent: PlayerRef).

By default, ignores Vanilla records, records with linked references or attached scripts.


Settings:

-fixDeleted: Undelete and disable records.

-debug: Leave it off, it's just for me to display some additional information.
